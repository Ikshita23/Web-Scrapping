# Web-Scrapping Job Portal

In this project, I scrapped data from Indeed.com using Python Scrappy. We look at how to search for a specific job name & location, crawl through the search results and then parse the associated job data and save as a csv file for excel.

It can be used to find the most recently posted jobs within the last one or two days - as some job postings would be taken down if the number of applications reached the required count.

Referencing the above mentioned blog post I had used BeautifulSoup. The query, location and age (no of days) variables have been used to identify a job type.
